Basically what this game is all about is that we have to remember the order in which we previously pressed the buttons and everytime we are corrct , the user is made to have an increase  in level . 
The game ends when the user presses the buttons in wrong sequence ,or anyhow the sequence goes wrong.
THE MOMENT THE SEQUENCE GOES WRONG "IT SHOWS GAME OVER RE-START AGAIN"
